REM Commands Linux

REM touch — Creates a file

REM touch is going to be the easiest way to create new files, but it can also be used to change timestamps on files and/or directories. You can create as many files as you want in a single command without worrying about overwriting files with the same name.
REM Syntax: touch [option(s)] file_name(s)
REM Common options: -a, -m, -r, -d
REM To create multiple files at the same time, separate the file names by space.
STRING touch example1.txt example2.txt example3.doc

REM ls — List directory contents

REM ls is probably the most common command. A lot of times, you’ll be working in a directory and you’ll need to know what files are located there. The ls command allows you to quickly view all files within the specified directory.
REM Syntax: ls [option(s)] [file(s)]
REM Common options: -a, -l
STRING ls
DELAY 1000
ENTER
DELAY 2000
STRING clear

REM You could use ls to list all these files by adding a wild card. What’s a wild card? Wild cards allow you to search for files given certain criteria.
REM The asterisk * wild card allows you to match instances of a character. To view all the text files in Donuts, use:
STRING ls *".txt"

REM pwd — Print working directory

REM pwd is used to print the current directory you’re in. As an example, if you have multiple terminals going and you need to remember the exact directory you’re working within, then pwd will tell you.
REM Syntax: pwd [option(s)]
REM Common options: options aren’t typically used with pwd
REM When you launch the terminal, you are in the home directory of your user. This usually looks something like “/home/username”. The pwd, print working directory command lets you know which directory you are in.
REM The path it gives is the absolute path. The absolute path starts from the root, which is the base of the Linux file system. This is denoted by the slash /.
STRING pwd

REM > — redirect stdout

REM The > character is the redirect operator. This takes the output from the preceding command that you’d normally see in the terminal and sends it to a file that you give it. As an example, take echo “contents of file1” > file1. Here it creates a file called file1 and puts the echoed string into it.
REM Syntax: >
REM Common options: n/a

REM echo — Prints text to the terminal window

REM echo prints text to the terminal window and is typically used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a computer file. Echo is also particularly useful for showing the values of environmental variables, which tell the shell how to behave as a user works at the command line or in scripts.
REM Syntax: echo [option(s)] [string(s)]
REM Common options: -e, -n
STRING echo “contents of file1” > example1.txt
DELAY 1000
