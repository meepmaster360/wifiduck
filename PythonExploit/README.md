On the same machine, change your working directory to the one containing the files youâ€™re transferring. Be aware of the fact that the entire contents of your current working directory may be accessible to anyone on your network (or the Internet if the sending machine has a public IP address), while the Python HTTP server is running.

#
You can now start the HTTP server. For Python 2.x, use the SimpleHTTPServer module:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
Or http.server in the case of Python 3.x:
```
python3 -m http.server
```
Both variations listen on port 8000 by default, though you can explicitly specify a different port number after the module name.
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]
python3 -m http.server [port]
```
Note: root privileges are required if you choose a port under 1024.

#
Using Wget
To download a single file with Wget, simply invoke Wget followed by the URL of the file you want to download.

wget http://IP_ADDRESS:8000/filename
Python Http Transfer Wget
You can also use Wget to recursively download the whole directory by adding the -r command-line flag.

wget -r http://IP_ADDRESS:8000/
#
Using cURL
By default, curl tries to print file contents to your terminal. So to save the file instead, specify a filename with the -o flag.

curl http://IP_ADDRESS:8000/filename -o filename
